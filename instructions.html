        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a
          classic two-player game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the
          players take turns marking empty squares with their respective symbols
          (X or O). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a
          horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to create a line of three of your
          symbols (X or O) either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the
          game board.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          Players take turns placing their symbols on the empty cells of the 3x3
          grid. Each player makes one move per turn. The game stops when a
          player successfully aligns three of their symbols in a row, either
          horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when all cells are filled,
          resulting in a draw.
